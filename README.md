# Projects

Here I have (old) projects of mine from programming classes. They are here to show the growth of my programming skills from the beginning to the present. 
I'm planning on showcasing more of my skills as more of my projects are finished.

You will find files of my school old(er) Java programming projects:

- LAKI2 (language based programming 2 practice project n:o 2)
- OOPE2 (object-oriented programming 2 practice project n:o 1)
- OOPE2 (object-oriented programming 2 practice project n:o 2)

Snippets from more recent coding:

- TKO (database programming project, took files solely written by me)
- PK (project course [GPS functionality])

Thank you.
