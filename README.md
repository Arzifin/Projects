# Projects

These are two old projects of mine from object-oriented programming classes. They are here to show the grwoth of my programming skills from the beginning to now. I'm planning on showcasing more of my skills by finishing more projects, shows of my skills.

- LAKI2 (language based programming 2 practice project n:o 2)
- OOPE2 (object-oriented programming 2 practice project n:o 1)
