# Projects

These are two old projects of mine from object-oriented programming classes. They are here to show the grwoth of my programming skills from the beginning to now. I'm planning on showcasing more of my skills when I finish my webpage.

You will find a file ((Old) Object-oriented programming projects) with projects:
- OOPE1 (object-oriented programming 1 practice project n:o 2)
- OOPE2 (object-oriented programming 2 practice project n:o 1)

Thank you.
